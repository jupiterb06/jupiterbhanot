					i was thinking about beauty and how to me everything is so beautiful and how i started looking for beauty and wonder and aesthetic and artistry as a standin for the intrinsic happiness that i'm supposed to feel. a lover let me down retroactively so i asked a friend what is was he said about artists and love and he said that our work consumes and infests us and turns us into observers, outsiders to our own lives who see the artistry before and above all else. THESE THOUGHTS RELATE SOMEHOW. i'm writing this on my way home to california which is feeling less and less like home and i think it's because i've come to associate home with freedom and peace which are two things i struggle to get in that house, where i hide my testosterone and shave my armpits. i'm lonely at home. maybe i don't have the freedom not to be or because i came out lonely and now that's just the aura of that house. i think my whole family likes parties because we all came out lonely and confused and now we need a pretense to connect and beauty to hide our chains.">

							<h2>nested (2025)</h2>
							<h3>made for and exhibited in <cite>interactions</cite> (2025)</h3>

							<p><cite>nested</cite> is most succinctly described as a rationalist-horroresque retelling
								slash analysis
								of <cite>the thousand and one nights</cite>. i was inspired heavily by a childhood spent
								playing
								open-world online games like imvu and second life. this piece interrogates what it
								means for something to be “virtual” or “real”, and to offer the perspective that our
								reality is relative and, as the title suggests, nested.

							</p>
							<p>the goal was not to be
								nihilist, but to open up questions of control and perception.
								it’s possible to just pick a direction and go on forever into the empty
								space, until you can no longer hear the audio track or see any of the sets. i
								wanted to capture that
								feeling of clicking through the virtual rooms of gamers long gone, that eerie stillness
								juxtaposed with the medium evidence of intent and life.
							</p>

							<p>this piece was originally created for the meta quest 3 headset. however,
								due hardware restrictions, no download is currently available. that being said,
								if you have a meta quest 3, and are interested in running this, i've uploaded the unity
								package file to my github.
