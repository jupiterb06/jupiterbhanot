					i was thinking about beauty and how to me everything is so beautiful and how i started looking for beauty and wonder and aesthetic and artistry as a standin for the intrinsic happiness that i'm supposed to feel. a lover let me down retroactively so i asked a friend what is was he said about artists and love and he said that our work consumes and infests us and turns us into observers, outsiders to our own lives who see the artistry before and above all else. THESE THOUGHTS RELATE SOMEHOW. i'm writing this on my way home to california which is feeling less and less like home and i think it's because i've come to associate home with freedom and peace which are two things i struggle to get in that house, where i hide my testosterone and shave my armpits. i'm lonely at home. maybe i don't have the freedom not to be or because i came out lonely and now that's just the aura of that house. i think my whole family likes parties because we all came out lonely and confused and now we need a pretense to connect and beauty to hide our chains.">
